# FileRenamer
Python script to recursively rename sub-strings within the filename in a folder.

## Steps:
1. Run the python script.
2. Enter Path of Folder to change file names within.
3. Enter string/substring to replace in File Names
4. Enter string to replace with in File Names


## Example Usage:

To replace "julia_plus" in "julia_plus_model_0.6_pc_low.inst.cfg" and all similar files having "julia_plus" in its filename in the path of the folder specified. 

# Note:
If path also contains the string to be changed, it will throw an error. It only renames files, not folder.
